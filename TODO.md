# Todo

This is a nice noticeboard for what I want to do or am currently doing. To try and add a bit of transparency to the project.

## Plans

### Right Now

- File links should be unrelated to the store method, use redirects to redirect the correct content
- Add Generic store class for future methods
- Add option to for enabling/disabling re-encoding content depending on type
- Add option to re-encode content in gelbooru import
- Add option for maximum file size on re-encode

## Near Future

- Implement perisitnant database
- Create proper user accounts
- Require captcha + email verification in signup
- Add password reset email
- Enable post creation and editting
